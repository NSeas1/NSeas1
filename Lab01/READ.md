My Command Line Shell is: Windows PowerShell

### Navigating My OS on the Command Line

1. Full / absolute path to your user's home directory:
2. Create a directory named `DirA`:
3. Create a directory named `Dir B`:
4. Go into `DirA`:
5. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`:
6. Return to your user's home directory:
7. Create a file named `test.txt`:
8. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`:
9. Contents of `test.txt`:

## Citations
ChatGPT (OpenAI) assisted me with finding the Command Line commands (Part 2). I feed it a prompt of the words and it described what each one did.
To add citations, provide the site and a summary of what it assisted you with.  If generative AI was used, include which generative AI system was used and what prompt(s) you fed it.
